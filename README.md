# 🔍 Ultimate Link Safety Checker

Ever hovered over a link and thought,  
> "Hmm… this smells like trouble 👃💣"?

## Meet your new URL bouncer 🚨

**Ultimate Link Safety Checker** is a lightweight browser tool that checks if a URL is suspicious, shady, sketchy, scammy… or safe!  
Because in 2025, even links wear disguises. 🕵️‍♂️

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ **HTTPS & HSTS detection** — is your link even secure, bro?
- 🧠 **Entropy check** — does the URL look like it was smashed on a keyboard?
- 📛 **Blacklist detection** — catches known bad actors like `phishing.tk`, `malware.ru`, etc.
- 🎭 **Typo-squatting check** — did someone spell `gooogle.com`? Yeah, caught that.
- 🧬 **Suspicious keywords**, shady extensions, excessive query parameters, and emoji/unicode in URLs.
- 💻 **Clipboard copy**, reset, dark mode, and automatic **link history** in localStorage.
- 💡 Runs **completely offline** — because safety shouldn’t need internet permission.
